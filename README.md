## Features
- **Data Transmission:** Send data between processes using the signal mechanism.
- **Signal Handling:** Utilize sigaction to set up custom signal handlers.
- **Bitwise Manipulation:** Translate characters into binary representations for transmission.
- **Error Handling:** Handles potential errors during signal transmission.

## How It Works
1. **Server Initialization:** The server process starts and waits for signals from the client.
2. **Data Preparation:** The client process translates the data into a binary representation.
3. **Data Transmission:** Each bit of the binary representation is transmitted as either a SIGUSR1 (for bit 0) or SIGUSR2 (for bit 1).
4. **Data Reception:** The server receives each signal and reconstructs the original data using bitwise manipulation.
5. **Acknowledgment:** Once the server successfully reconstructs a byte, it sends an acknowledgment signal back to the client.
